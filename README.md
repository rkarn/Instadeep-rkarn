# Instadeep-rkarn

This repository contains the source code to run the hyper-parameter tuning experimentations inside a docker container using the "Instadeep" Cloud platform. 

It uses two intrusion detection datasets, namely `ASNM` and `Malnet`. The reference those is `https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ihomoliak/asnm/`, `https://mal-net.org/` respectively. It is still in the development phase because, in the mid-way of the experimentation, we lost access to the `Instadeep` cloud. We will work on it in the future.
